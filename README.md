# mango_disease_detection

This project aims to detect the presence of disease in a given mango leaf image. 
The dataset is taken from Kaggle: A Database of Leaf Images: from Mendeley Data 
Please find the dataset in the mango folder.
We use an Image generator for dataimage augmentation.
The notebook contains the entire worflow of the CNN model building and results. 
We achieved a very high accuracy on our train and validation sets.

We have published a research paper on this project titled "Detecting Diseases in Mango Leaves usingConvolutional Neural Networks" at the ICICC 2021.
